## About me

I am a student currently working towards completing a dual-enrollment program for a software development diploma at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology, alongside a high school diploma.

For the past two years, I've been enrolled in the Pembina Trails Early College (PTEC) program. PTEC is a technologically focused school program where I learned a variety of topics in Networking, Cybersecurity, and Web Design. After studying an array of technological topics for two years, I continued my education at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology.

I have worked on various personal and client projects involving the design and development of websites using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
