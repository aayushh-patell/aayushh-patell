## About Me

Hi, I'm Aayush! üëã Thanks for stopping by my profile. Here's a few things about me:

üéì I'm in my second year in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo

üíº I'm experienced in software engineering with a range of tech stacks and languages, including C#, C, C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and more

üëæ I've always been interested in cybersecurity and networking. I've already completed intro to hardware, networking, and cybersecurity certifications from Cisco, and I'm working towards obtaining my CompTIA Security+ certification

ü§ù I'm always looking to get involved in organisations working towards social good. I'm excited to be volunteering at UW Blueprint‚Äìa student design team at the University of Waterloo‚Äìthat works with nonprofit organisations to built digital tools to accomplish their missions

üéâ Outside of tech, I love visiting national and provincial parks, learning new languages, and making digital art

üôå Feel free to reach out. I love meeting new people and hearing about new opportunities!
