## About Me

As a dedicated and ambitious student, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to challenge myself and grow my skillset. That's why I am excited to be enrolled in the Pembina Trails Early College (PTEC) program, where I have had the opportunity to learn and work on a variety of projects in fields such as game development, web development, networking, and cyber security.

In addition to my studies at PTEC, I am also attending the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (MITT) where I am focusing on web design and development. I have always been drawn to the creativity and problem-solving skills required in this field, and I am excited to continue honing my abilities and learning new techniques.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I am also an active member of my community, volunteering my time and skills to various causes. I believe that it is important to give back and make a positive impact in the world, and I try to do so in any way that I can.

I am passionate about using my skills and knowledge to create innovative and engaging digital experiences for users. I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow, and I am excited to see where my interests in technology and development will take me in the future.
